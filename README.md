# ISAAC KINYANJUI NGUGI

I'm a dedicated digital health and climate change activist, driven by the undeniable connection between diseases and weather changes. My mission is to harness my tech skills to create a future where health crises induced by climate change are not only minimized but also prevented. As a computer science major with a minor in data science, I am passionate about leveraging the power of data to make a significant impact on both health and climate change. By utilizing data-driven solutions, we can ensure that all economic classes benefit from improved healthcare, creating a healthier and more equitable world. 🌍
